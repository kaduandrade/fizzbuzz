# fizzbuzz Java  
### Step 1  
A program that prints out the following for a contiguous range of numbers:

 1. Prints the number if not matches any rule presented below
 2. Prints **“fizz”** for numbers that are divisible of **3**
 3. Prints **“buzz”** for numbers that are divisible of **5**
 4. Prints **“fizzbuzz”** for numbers that are divisible of **15**

**Example:**
If the program is executed with the range **1-30**, it should print the following to output:
***1 2 fizz 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz 13 14 fizzbuzz 16 17 fizz 19 buzz fizz 22 23 fizz buzz 26 fizz 28 29 fizzbuzz***

### Step 2
Change the program of **Step 1** with these new requirements:

 1. Prints the text **"polo"**, not printing the previous requirement, if the number contains a **6**

**Example:**
If the program is executed with the range **1-30**, it should print the following to output:
***1 2 fizz 4 buzz polo 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz 13 14 fizzbuzz polo 17 fizz 19 buzz fizz 22 23 fizz buzz polo fizz 28 29 fizzbuzz***

### Step 3
Change the program of **Step 2** with these new requirements:

 1. At the end of the program, prints a statistics report showing the number of times and the percentage of the decisions

**Example:**
If the program is executed with the range **1-30**, it should print the following to output:
**1 2 fizz 4 buzz polo 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz 13 14 fizzbuzz polo 17 fizz 19 buzz fizz 22 23 fizz buzz polo fizz 28 29 fizzbuzz**
**integer,14,46
fizz,7,23
buzz,4,13
fizzbuzz,2,6
polo,3,10**

## Other requirements
**All the step programs must have:**

 - Unit tests
 - Excellent unit test coverage
